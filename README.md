# Final_Mark_Calculator
Calculate the final mark you'd receive in a course

This program calculates the final mark you'd receive in a course for a range of marks you could receive in the exam. 
It is useful to use this application near the end of your course when you already know all your marks and you only have your exam left to write.
This way, you can see how well you will do in the course based on how well you do on the exam.
